# cortex service values
# training service - SINGLE INSTANCE BY DESIGN
#
# architecture decision: cortex runs as a single instance (event sourcing pattern)
#
# why single instance?
# - training is NOT on the hot path (doesn't affect selection latency)
# - ensures correct parameter updates (no race conditions between pods)
# - redis streams provides back-pressure (buffers spikes in feedback volume)
# - training operations are computationally cheap (handles thousands of events/sec)
# - simplicity: no distributed locks, no coordination overhead
#
# if cortex becomes a bottleneck:
# 1. vertical scaling (increase cpu/memory)
# 2. increase batch size for better throughput
# 3. shard by experiment (each cortex owns subset of experiments)

# single instance - this is intentional, not a limitation
